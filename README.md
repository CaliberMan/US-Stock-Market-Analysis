# US-Stock-Market-Analysis

Through this project I would like to explore the topic of US Stocks and analyse the investment strategies, used by investment groups to maximize their profits, to understand their effectivness. As an investor I find it critical to do my own research and understand the different strategies that can be used in investing.


## 1. Topic: 2023 Spring. US Stocks Analysis
- Interest in Investing and Stocks
- Learn about the different tools that can be used for stock analysis
- Learn about the effectivness of investment strategies

## 2. Hypothesis

#### - H1. Higher returns come with higher levels of risk also known as Risk-Return Tradeoff

Test this hypothesis by analyzing the relationship between historical returns and volatility for different asset classes, such as stocks, bonds, or real estate.

#### - H2. Index Funds outperfoms Hedge Funds

Index funds are better choices for new investors than single-picked-stocks. Analyse the performance of hedge funds over a period of decades and compare it to different index funds such as the S&P 500.

#### - H3. Technical Analysis can predict stock movement

Examine if technical analysis can be used to predict future stock prices based on patterns in historical price and volume data. Analyze historical stock prices and test the predictive power of various technical indicators, such as moving averages or relative strength.
